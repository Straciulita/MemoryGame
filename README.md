Memory Game 🧠🎮
---
Welcome to the Memory Game! 🃏🎉

This is a classic Memory Card Matching Game created in Java using Swing. The objective of the game is to find pairs of matching cards by flipping them two at a time. Each incorrect attempt will count as an error, and the game will display the number of errors at the top of the screen. You can restart the game at any time using the "Restart Game" button.

How It Works 🤔
---
  Objective: Your goal is to find pairs of matching cards by flipping them over. The game will end when all pairs are found.
  Game Board: The game consists of a 4x4 grid of cards (16 cards in total, 8 matching pairs).
  Flipping Cards: When you click on a card, it reveals its image. You can flip two cards at a time to try to find a match.
  Matching: If the two flipped cards match, they remain visible. If not, they will be flipped back after a brief delay.
  Error Count: The number of mistakes (incorrect matches) is tracked and displayed in real-time at the top of the game.
  Restart Game: You can restart the game at any time using the "Restart Game" button, which shuffles the cards and resets the error count.
